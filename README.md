# Burger App

# Description

This application allows the user to add the hamburgers they desired to devour and delete the input. 

Once the user visits this website, the user is given an location to input a text, preferrably relating to hamburgers. Once the user types the type of burger he/she would like to eat, then the user can press 'enter' on his/her keyboard or click on the 'add burger' button. The input the user type will be displayed on the left side of the page under 'delicious burgers' list. 

The input (considering it is a type of hamburger) will have two buttons next to it. A 'devour this' button and a 'delete' button. If the user wants to eat the hamburger, he/she can click 'devour this' and the hamburger will move to the right side of the page under the "devoured burgers' list, indicating the hamburger was devoured. There will be a 'delete' button next to the devoured burger where the user can click to the delete the devoured burger.
